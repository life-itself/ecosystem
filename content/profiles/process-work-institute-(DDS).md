# Description

The Process Work Institute is a non-profit educational institute devoted to vocational education, research and training in Process-oriented Psychology, also known as Processwork.
# Vision

Our vision is of a sustainable, flourishing, deeply democratic world that values all viewpoints and all levels of experience, and facilitates their interaction in order to reveal the potential meaning and growth that lies at the heart of even the most disturbing human experiences.

We dream of a world where everyone has the skills, understanding and ability to facilitate the process of relating (to oneself, to others, to the world) because we have seen how this can bring unexpected solutions and relief to many areas of human striving, including personal and social development; post-war recovery; conflicts in organizational, social and domestic settings; interpersonal issues; and individual distress and life challenges.
# Core Values

We are committed to a learning environment that:

1. Views the individual and his or her unique personal style as an integral part of the learning process
2. Fosters an atmosphere of collaboration, experimentation, and mutual discovery in learner-teacher interaction
3. Provides intensive and experiential instruction using onsite, distance and online learning modes of delivery that strengthens student learning
4. Connects the student’s skill development to his or her own personal process and unique style
5. Emphasizes the role of community and relationship in the learning process
6. Promotes dialogue, inclusion, and intercultural competence.

# Practices

Teens will engage in creative activities to increase personal power, find their unique gifts, build communication skills, strengthen relationship and facilitate conflict within themselves and in groups.

We support youth in their own leadership by teaching them to believe in their innate creativity, to appreciate internal and external diversity and to forge real relationships across differences. We teach them the skills they will need in order to recognize, work with and resolve conflict.
