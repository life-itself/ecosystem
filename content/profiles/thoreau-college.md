# Description

Thoreau College models a transformative liberal arts curriculum that immerses students in authentic community, shared labor and governance, and rigorous engagement with great works and natural phenomena. Thoreau College creates a context where students can nurture their sacred curiosity, connect with their deepest selves, and cultivate the capacities they will need to manifest their highest aspirations for the world.
# Vision
# Core Values

Thoreau College understands liberal arts education to be fundamentally concerned with the cultivation of free human beings who have the capacity to impart direction and meaning to their lives and bring about positive transformation in the world. In our striving to realize an education that meets the needs of the whole human being–body, soul and spirit–we have been deeply informed by the lives and work of Henry David Thoreau (author of Walden), Rudolf Steiner (founder of Waldorf education), and LL Nunn (founder of Deep Springs College).

# Program(s) Structure

The Metamorphosis Gap Semester is a full time fall program incorporating intellectual work, fine arts and traditional crafts, homesteading skills, participatory self-governance, wilderness expeditions, and engaged community life.  Each fall we explore a unique set of ideas and texts while engaging in activities set by the rhythms of natural and agricultural year and by the [Five Pillars of the Thoreau College Curriculum](https://thoreaucollege.org/curriculum/). Together with an intimate cohort of up to 14 fellow students, Gap Semester participants embark on an immersive four-month long journey of discovery and growth through the changing seasons.
# Practices

The overarching themes of the semester are questions of place, community, meaning, spirituality, and, above all, the relationship between human beings and nature.  In short, these are fundamental questions about how we might live authentically and morally with ourselves, with other people, and with the other creatures with whom we share the Earth. Our exploration of these themes includes discussions of readings drawn from a cross-cultural selection of literature, philosophy, social and ecological science, and sacred texts both ancient and modern.  These discussions are enriched by field trips and conversations and collaborations with members of the local community striving to live examined lives of meaning and purpose.

Our explorations are also informed by practical experiences with homemaking –  fall harvest and food preservation skills, working with wood, clay, wool, and and other natural materials, and participation in service work and seasonal celebrations in the context of our vibrant rural community.  Throughout the semester students learn and practice a variety of practical homesteading skills and folk arts, such as spoon carving, basket making, gardening,, foraging for wild foods, canning, pickling, and fermenting, harvesting fruits and vegetables, and, for those who are interested, butchering chickens, pigs, and deer.
