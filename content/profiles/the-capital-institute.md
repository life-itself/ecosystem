# About 

Together with our global ecosystem of 1000+ change makers, we combine modern science, storytelling, and the knowledge of timeless wisdom traditions to illuminate the path from an extractive economy to an emerging regenerative economy that supports the long-term well-being of people, planet and business.

## Theory of Change 

Today’s greatest challenge is to address the root cause of our systemic crises – today’s dominant (neoliberal) economic paradigm and the financial system that fuels it and rules it – by transitioning to a more effective economic system design that is regenerative and therefore sustainable over the long term.

The universal patterns and principles nature uses to build stable, healthy, and sustainable systems throughout the real world can and must be used as a model for a new design of our economic system and the financial system that fuels it.
