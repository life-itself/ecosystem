# Description

Teach For America is a leadership development organization for those who want to co-create a more just world alongside young people in their communities

1. The change we seek must be shaped by those of us who are most directly impacted by educational inequity alongside those whose identities and experiences differed. 
2. Racial inequity interrupts the possibilities of educational equity. The progress we seek is only possible if the coalition works.
