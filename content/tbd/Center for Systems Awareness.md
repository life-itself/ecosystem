"The Center for Systems Awareness honors the mind-heart-body system of the learner, the social reality of relationships, family and community that is the context for all learning, and responds to the need to engage learners of all ages in fostering systemic well-being at all levels, from the individual to the larger systems of institutions, society, economy and ecology.

We support and connect local communities in diverse settings developing a 'compassionate systems' approach to education that connects capacity building and community building to research and practice. This larger budding global community of compassionate systems practitioners, in turn, is part of a wider effort to come to a deeper understanding of the subtle aspects of systems awareness needed for sustaining deep change over time.""

## History

"The Center for Systems Awareness grew out of the former Society for Organizational Learning (SoL), an independent non-profit organization founded in 1997, which itself grew out of the MIT Center for Organizational Learning originally founded in 1990."
