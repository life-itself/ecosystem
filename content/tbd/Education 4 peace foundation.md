Education 4 Peace (E4P) is a Swiss non-profit foundation dedicated to advocating and supporting Emotional Health (EH) programs in schools and sports.

E4P has a background connected with the provision of free emotional support [hotlines](http://www.ifotes.org/), through which thousands of volunteers have been trained worldwide in listening skills and empathy over the past 50 years. At the heart of this work is an approach known as Active Listening, pioneered in the 1950s by the psychologist [Carl Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers). E4P began by promoting listening skills in various environments through trainings, conferences, congresses and publications.

## Theory of Change 
  
Peace and non violence are becoming priorities in education. Knowledge, and know-how, are both enriched when we teach children to know themselves. Decades of psychology and personal development, linked to the need for a more peaceful world, are naturally leading us into an era of interpersonal skills contributing to health and wellbeing.
