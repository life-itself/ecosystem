# About 

Transform commerce to fund a just transition to a regenerative earth.

This includes rethinking brands so that they can preserve Earth’s diverse natural wealth.

## Theory of Change 

They have a model called the 'dandelion economy' which is a metaphorical way to describe a localized, regenerative economic model, wherein wealth is used to rejuvenate and sustain Indigenous and local communities much like a dandelion spreading its seeds to give new life.

In this model, wealth is primarily invested locally, instead of being concentrated in large corporations or distant markets.

Brand Earth will introduce the “Earth Pass”, a sustainable funding mechanism that supports regenerative initiatives and leverages a combination of public, private funding, and innovative financial instruments. This is aimed at redirecting resources from environmentally damaging practices.
