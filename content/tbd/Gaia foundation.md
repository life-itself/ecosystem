The Gaia Foundation is an organization that works on four core projects: seed sovereignty, earth jurisprudence, beyond extractivism, and sacred land and waters. 
They produce reports, raise awareness, connect stakeholders, and work towards creating networks and communities for a just transition. 

Their overall vision is "a new era in which humans are living in a respectful, just and mutually enhancing relationship with the Earth, with all her life forms and with each other."

Here as well are their "overall aims" that their projects are geared towards: 

"Reviving and protecting cultural and biological diversity in order to restore resilience for ecosystems and local communities, across connected landscapes.

Enhancing traditional knowledge and practices for land, seed, food and water sovereignty, thereby enabling communities to determine their own locally and culturally appropriate pathways rooted in regenerative principles and practices.

Linking with social movements who together can challenge the industrial growth economy and promote pathways for systemic transformation.

Speaking out for ‘Gaia’ – Mother Earth – and the rights of future generations of all species, yet to inhabit this planet.

Restoring a respectful relationship with, and a holistic understanding of, our one planet Earth.

Celebrating and re-weaving the web of Life, which sustains us all."

### Key people 

## Theory of Change 


They don't necessarily have a distinct theory of change, but the projects that they have and the values that they espouse are ones that point to a more meaningful and intense relationship with earth and local food systems. Deep transformation, then, requires these kinds of relationships. 

One of their main projects, for example,  'seed sovereignty' is described the following way: 

"Transforming the way seed is produced, saved, valued and shared is essential to ecological restoration, climate change resilience and a fair food and farming system. We believe that a food revolution starts with seed. In both Africa and the UK & Ireland Gaia is working with vibrant movements to help re-weave the conditions for seed and food sovereignty to thrive, nourishing both people and planet."
