# About 

Dragon Dream is "an open-source interactive networking phenomenon which provides technology and philosophy that assists Activists, informal community projects, NGOs, Government and Business Enterprises". They emphasize that this process, which has four steps- dreaming, planning, doing, celebrating- is about realizing "ones dreams and making them a reality."

It appears to be more than wishful thinking here, as they provide an integrated method for how to do this. They have a presence in Europe as well as other continents, like South and North America. It seems like, for the most part, they provide educational materials and host events.

### Key people 


## Theory of Change 

Like many orgs we have seen, they see 'two possible futures'- one which is business as usual, the other which requires deep transformational change. They believe that by 'dreaming' and putting these dreams into action through this method, we can create meaningful change.
