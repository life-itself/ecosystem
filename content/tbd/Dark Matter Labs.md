Dark Matter Labs is a non profit research group dedicated towards the transformation of societal pillars, ranging from the economy, law, and city design. They have over 10 locations in Europe. 

> We’re an ambitious not-for-profit designing and building the underlying infrastructure to support this new civic economy, exploring how ownership, legal systems, governance, accountancy and insurance might begin to change. We’re establishing toolkits and blueprints, pilots, and case studies, supporting communities and institutions with applications, digital products and civic technologies that challenge established thought and demonstrate that an alternative is possible. We’re working to initiate a boring revolution︎ that will propel wider societal transition. We began as a five-person experiment in London and we've become a global, multi-disciplinary, 60-person team with specialisms ranging across financing and lawmaking to economic art and data science. We don’t profess to know all the answers, but we’re continuing to ask the questions. We’re looking to work openly and collaboratively, sharing any findings and discoveries, developing a learning community and encouraging likeminded collaborators to pick up the work and apply it within their own contexts and geographies.(https://darkmatterlabs.org/)

## Theory of Change

Relationship building: As a global network, Dark Matter Labs stresses the importance of building networks and relationships as part of the global transformation process. Within particular geographic communities themselves they also stress the power of networks, as they aim to build "An economy that’s community-led, and based on many-to-many relationships. "

The boring Revolution: The research at Dark Matter Labs is geared towards a fundamental societal transition, or what they call a 'boring revolution'. This means designing a new future largely behind the scenes, in things like laws, financial agreements, zoning, and more. It requires making careful and intelligent decisions about how the future should be designed. More of what they mean by a boring revolution [can be found in this article.](https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956)

[Here is an example of a project that they recently did](https://darkmatterlabs.org/7GenCities) 

> 7GenCities is a new collaborative focused on transformative thinking and action for future city and community building and Earth stewardship. It is a commons where people can connect and share work and ideas, and build collaborations and deep demonstrations to manifest city transformation and civic reworlding together, including the multiple infrastructures required for that.
