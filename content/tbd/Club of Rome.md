# About 

The Club of Rome is a group of international economists and researchers  who are concerned with transforming the global financial world system. Here is what they have put on their website: 

According to their website, "The Club of Rome was created to address the multiple crises facing humanity and the planet. Drawing on the unique, collective know-how of our 100 members – notable scientists, economists, business leaders and former politicians – we seek to define comprehensive solutions to the complex, 
interconnected challenges of our world."

They have five different impact hubs: planetary emergency, emerging new civilizations, reframing economics, reframing finance, and youth leadership
and international dialogues. 

Generally speaking, their expertise and output is noteworthy and impressive. They produce a number of reports and publications which aim to transform our current global financial system and respond to planetary crisis.

## Theory of Change 

Their theory of change is definitely well informed and strategic: they have a large group of people who go deep into policy and try and create policies which are sustainable and transformative. 

"As a network of thought leaders from a rich diversity of expertise, our members are committed to facilitating the difficult conversations and the bold actions required to confront the planetary emergency facing humanity and our common home. Our goal is to actively advocate for paradigm and systems shifts which will enable society to emerge from our current crises, by promoting a new way of being human, 
within a more resilient biosphere."

## Connections 

Similar to Eutopia, they seem to be a particular kind of change agent that has a special capacity for systems change. In this case, it is the expertise of economists, scientists, and policy makers who are able to create meaningful and necessary policy for deep systems change at a societal level.
