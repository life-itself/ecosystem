>The Office for the Future is now being enacted as an umbrella initiative under which the key activist projects of The Center for Integral Wisdom together with the Foundation for Conscious Evolution, the Homo Amor Project, the Eros Project, One Mountain Many Paths, and the Outrageous Love Project and Festival, the Unique Self Institute and more, are being initiated.
>
>At the core of the mission and vision of the Office for the Future is the writing of a Great Library, in written and media form, which participates in evolving the source code of consciousness and culture. The Office for the Future further recognize the urgent need to activate a new information ecology. The information ecology must be rooted in a new shared story of human value as the matrix for the emergence of a New Human, and a New Humanity. It is only a New Story of the Possible Human and the Possible Humanity that has ever changed history and evolved culture and consciousness.

>The Office for the Future understands that sensemaking is essential for a new future. We have the science and technological capacity to feed and empower every human being and at the same time we stand poised between a level of suffering, catastrophic and existential risk that’s unimaginable. [...]
>
>Our specialized leadership training is specifically designed to articulate a shared story that generates global coherence. At core of this new story, we need new first principles and first values which forms the basis of a new global ethos for a global civilization.
>
>We’ve come together at the Office for the Future to articulate **_new_** first principles and **_new_** first values to help companies, governments, NGO’s, civic and spiritual communities and other structure activate these first values and first principles in their core DNA. The result will be a local coherence within your organization which will in turn participate in generating the global coherence and cooperation necessary for the emergence of the next stage of humanity.
