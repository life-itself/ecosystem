AXA climate school is an organization dedicated to teaching others about the climate crisis, although it's more specific and more tailored than The Climate Frisk. Instead of one general course, their workshops and courses seem to be much longer and more extensive. They are thus classified in the kinds of orgs concerned with 'education and consulting' other existing orgs about the climate crisis and how to be more sustainable, although they do it in a more extensive way than a single workshop or single awareness course. They appear to offer unique and contextual solutions and recommendations about sustainable solutions, depending on  the organization.

Below here is their 'Manifesto'

**We** see planetary boundaries as a framework within which human activities, especially business activities, must be observed for long-term global sustainability.

**We** are convinced that organisations must transition to a sustainable business models.

**We** believe that organisations need to train their employees and stakeholders in order to succeed in that transition.

**We** contribute to this need for training by offering science based accessible content to your entire workforce.

**We** know that training alone will not transform companies and the society. There is a growing ecosystem trying to shift we approach things. We are their allies.
