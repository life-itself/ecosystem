# About

Sprouts is a learning community inspired by Schumacher College based at Froidefontaine Farm, an agroecological farm in Belgium.

"The Sprouts offer an educational programme with transformative courses for ecological, social and personal change. We apply a range of teachings and learning methods, varying from lectures to reflective inquiry, with an emphasis on action in the participantsâ€™ own lives. The connection with nature is at the heart of all courses while there is always a focus on how to be and act in a changing world. We are convinced that these competences are key to build a sustainable future."

# Theory of Change

- Sprouts was founded by a group of Schumacher College graduates. Their activities and offerings are deeply inspired by Schumacher College principles and teachings. 

"Inspired by [Schumacher College](https://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/), we offer a range of courses for personal and professional development in a transforming world. The courses are centered around a Trinity we deem essential for our time: **Soil**, **Soul**, **Society**."
