"1000 Landscapes for 1 Billion People (1000L) is a radical collaboration of change agents working together to accelerate landscape efforts to sustain and restore ecosystems, build rural prosperity and confront climate change.

1000L is convened by EcoAgriculture Partners and co-led with Rainforest Alliance, Commonland, Conservation International, the United Nations Development Programme, and information technology leader Tech Matters. Another 20+ partners are sharing technical and financial expertise, and 12+ Landscape Partnerships are co-designing the initiative. Together, these organizations already engage with over 250 Landscape Partnerships worldwide and are positioned to provide a strategic bridge with international and national programs championing Landscape Partnerships."
