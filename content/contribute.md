## Content

Do you have a deep understanding of one (or more) of the ecosystem’s key traditions, movements, or philosophies? We’re looking to build up a library of content to help people understand the ideas and work of the ecosystem better. This might include material on key terms, influential ideas, major figures, history/lineage etc. If you have, or would like to write, content that you think might fit well in this library, please [get in touch &raquo;][contact].

## Get Involved

We'd love help in every area of this project from research and writing to visualization and coding. If you'd like to get involved, or are already doing work you think might be complementary then please [get in touch &raquo;][contact].

## Resourcing

We would welcome the sharing of any opportunities for resourcing, or offers of direct support! We are currently undertaking the project using only our own internal resources, which limits the scope and speed of our activities. Additional resources could make a big difference to sustaining and expanding this work. [Get in touch &raquo;][contact].
