# About 

The SDG Thought Leader Club seems to be a group of experts who hold conversations on and aim to develop a better global understanding of how the SDG's can be implemented in a short amount of time. This is their strategy:

- Articulating and promulgating an evolutionary approach toward environmental and social health that is targeted directly toward those involved in or otherwise influencing the framing of the SDGs. This will be done through publications, video presentations, and other forms of dissemination and communication.
- Conducting meetings and convenings with key SDG leaders to gain their alignment and commitment to evolutionary principles.
- Assisting SDG leaders in the application of those principles in the arenas where they have influence.
- Equipping other ELs and then a widening expanse of colleagues in strategies to embrace and apply the evolutionary principles to SDG efforts and beyond.
- Fostering networking and synergy among circle members to strengthen our efforts to support this SDG Thought Leader Circle collaboration.

## Theory of Change 

They believe, like most organisations, that change needs to be both 'deep' and 'rapid'. Of course, they highlight the SDG's as the primary vehicle of change. An interesting point that they make on their website is that "  the key to the success, or the failure, of SDG2030 is found not in the policies themselves, but in how they’re implemented." As mentioned, they have more of a 'dialogue' based theory of change in how the goals can be implemented, and aim to guide the policy development through this dialogue and understanding. They put it the following way on their website: 

'We will be a catalyst for critical dialogue and exchange on the  goals, targets, indicators and make recommendations for improving this global effort for transformational change. This requires addressing the root causes of why we are in the state we are in today, as well as mobilizing the needed shift in consciousness and behavior to implement critical SDGs  e.g. sustainable consumption and production; equitable distribution of opportunity; economic, social and climate justice. We are taking initial steps to form a Unity Cluster under the UN NGO Major Group,  cultivating  working relationships with various UN member state and civil society negotiators so we can lobby effectively to offer new visions and strategies with regard to implementing Agenda 2030.''
