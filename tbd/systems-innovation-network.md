# About 

The Si Network is an online platform connecting people around the world to learn and apply the ideas and methods of systems innovation towards addressing complex challenges. According to their website "Systems innovation is a new approach to innovation that tries to tackle complex social and environmental challenges through the use of more holistic & innovation driven approaches. It is a kind of innovation that aims to change  the underlying structure of a system, thus potentially enabling a more transformational kind of change".

The organization provides different 'hubs', which are themes to connect certain sectors. One example is the 'cities hub' which shares information on systems change for cities, and there is roughly two posts a week, mostly from moderators, 
on content about cities and systems innovation. 

They seem to be an organization that is able to provide a number of actors, resources, and potential projects in one platform. The platform, too, is quite nice and clean, and seems to work well and have a good amount of involvement. 
### Key people

## Theory of Change 

We are building an ecosystem of individuals and organizations co-learning and co-creating systems innovation across geographies and sectors. This ecosystem is enabled by our online platform which provides educational content, toolkits, organizes events and projects as well as provides various support services for organizations. 

As mentioned above, they believe that transformation occurs when it is systemic; or atleast more meaningful kinds of transformation. Thus, they aim to innovate 'solutions' which can transform how systems operate.
