# About 

The Dolphin Embassy is an international non-governmental mission with the main goal to promulgate an integral worldview and create a cultural space for the preservation and sustainable harmonious development of life on Earth.

The Embassy is a cultural center, as well as research, information, consultancy and production center whoseÂ activities are associated with dolphins and whales, who represent the most ancient form of intelligence on Earth, inhabit evidently the larger part of its surface, have abilities, and lead lives that provide lessons of great importance for humans.

## Theory of Change 

The Embassy proceeds from the knowledge that the world we live in is undivided and whole, and at present the only really urgent task is to prevent the dangers presented to its existence by the consumerist activities of humans. Overcoming all kinds of disunity, disconnectedness, alienation caused by shallow outlook on the world is an indispensible precondition of it.

Development and Life create unity.
