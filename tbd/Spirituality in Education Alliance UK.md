## Theory of Change 

They believe that education in 'spirituality' is a fundamental component to addressing systems change. This sort of education can not only transform individuals but how individuals relate to one another and understand and shape the world they live in. Here are a few components as to how they define 'spirituality' in education and some its dimensions: 

**Spirituality** is understood as an innate human quality, that pre-exists cultural or religious differences, that stems from a unified reality and that is grounded in connection and love. As such, it is an essential element for human flourishing.  
  
**Moral** development should explore the core values and ethical narratives that we want to see in the world  
  
**Social** development is about celebrating and promoting human diversity within an essential unity, and  
  
**Cultural** development should foster an understanding of what shapes identity and belonging within an appreciation of interconnectedness and service to others.
