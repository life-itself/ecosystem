    "description": "We are pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. \n\nWe create coliving hubs, start businesses, do research and engage in activism to pioneer a wiser culture. We are ordinary people who choose an extra-ordinary path, treading the middle way between Plum Village and Silicon Valley.\n\nDespite our wealth and technologies, we are struggling at both a personal and collective levels. Personally, we are are not truly happy, satisfied and at peace; collectively we are failing to act powerfully on issues ranging from climate change to health. We believe the roots of both of these lie in our culture – which is grounded in materialism, technology and individualism – and thus a breakthrough requires a transformation in culture: the views, values, beliefs, practices that underlie our collective way of being.\n\nReal change requires us to work, and even live, together – hence creating co-living spaces and businesses; and to share ideas through writing and events, ultimately engaging in politics and social change.\n\nWe balance the spiritual and the rational. We like meditation as much as we like getting things done. We want meaningful work and a meaningful life. We value the environment and technology, art and science. We take action, both personal and political. We’re the middle way between the suit and the hippy, between the billionaire and the monk.\n\n\n",

    "description": "In 2009, two English writers published a manifesto. Out of that manifesto grew a cultural movement: a rooted and branching network of creative activity, centred on the Dark Mountain journal, sustained by the work of a growing gang of collaborators and contributors, as well as the support of thousands of readers around the world.\n\nThere’s never been a simple answer to the question, ‘What is Dark Mountain?’ It’s many things, but here are seven of them.\n\n1. A conversation\n\nIt started, as lots of things do just now, on the internet. Dougald Hine and Paul Kingsnorth had been leaving comments on each other’s blogs and this led to a conversation over email, then in quiet corners of pubs. Slowly, over the months, they found enough common ground to embark on a project together.\n\nThat project has taken many forms: a manifesto, an ongoing series of books, four annual festivals and far more events, collaborations and friendships. But among all that followed, it often seems that what has mattered most to people are the quiet conversations that happen around Dark Mountain, often late at night, around a campfire or on a computer screen. Conversations where we get to name our fears, our doubts, our uncertainties and our fragile hopes.\n\n2. A manifesto\n\nThis twenty-page pamphlet took Dark Mountain out into the world, travelling further than its authors ever anticipated. It was written in the autumn of 2008, as the financial system shook to its foundations. ‘All around us, shifts are underway which suggest that our whole way of living is already passing into history.’ Not only the destabilisation of the project of economic globalisation which had dominated the preceding decades, but the fraying of the ecological foundations as a result of industrial exploitation.\n\nFaced with this unravelling, the manifesto calls us to question the stories our societies like to tell about the world and our place within it: the myth of progress, the myth of human separation from nature, the myth of civilisation. And it claims a particular role for storytellers and culturemakers in a time when the stories we live by have become untenable. This is the project of ‘Uncivilised’ art and writing set out in the invitation which closes the manifesto. \n\n3. A series of beautifully-made books\nIn the pages of the Dark Mountain journal, you will meet the work of writers, thinkers and artists who have taken up the invitation made in the manifesto. Since our first issue, launched in Summer 2010, publishing these books has been the core activity of the project. Each issue takes the form of a beautifully-produced hardback where a wide mixture of voices and styles intertwine.\nSince 2014, we have published two issues a year – and starting with Issue 8, each year’s autumn book has broken from our established format to plunge deeper into a special theme (technology, poetics, the sacred, the land, fiction), while the odd-numbered spring issues return to the classic format and range of work. With each issue, we make a public call for contributions, so look out for the call-outs on this site, or sign up for our newsletter to make sure you hear about the next one.\n\n4. A gathering place\nBefore we had even published our first book, an invitation came to host a weekend of talks, performances and workshops in Llangollen, Wales. This led to the creation of Uncivilisation, an annual festival which we ran between 2010-13. It was through the festival that many of the current Dark Mountain team first met and got to know each other.\nAfter four years, we decided it was time to lay down the responsibility of running a single annual event in one corner of the British Isles. But the opportunity to meet in person, rather than over screens, is still very much part of the life of the project – whether that is through collaborations with the organisers of larger festivals, local gatherings, talks, workshops or courses at the small schools created by Dark Mountain collaborators.\n\n5. A branching web of collaborations\nThis project started out with an invitation to writers and artists, people whose work could find a home within the pages of the books we wanted to publish. But it soon became clear that the manifesto was inspiring many other kinds of activity.\nFrom a huge mural on the side of a closed-down art college in Doncaster, to a number one album in Norway, to a year-long artistic workshop at Sweden’s national theatre – these are just a few of the unexpected manifestations of this widening web of collaborations.\n\n6. A bridge between worlds\nIt’s Saturday morning at the second Uncivilisation festival. In the main tent, the speaker has thirty audience volunteers penned within a tight square of rope, reenacting the overcrowding of the cell into which he was thrust on his first day in a Russian prison. Among the other voices we hear in that session, there’s an ex-Wikileaks hacker, a security activist working with resistance movements in North Africa and the Middle East, and a former banker from Ireland who speaks furiously about the system inside which he used to work.\nOn festival stages and in the pages of our books, we’ve sought to make Dark Mountain a bridge between worlds, a place of unexpected juxtapositions. For sure, those who are drawn to the conversations and collaborations going on around this project tend to have certain experiences in common. But we’re not interested in creating a subculture, a shared identity in which we can take refuge. There are many voices here and no party line. We don’t try to hide our differences, or to debate each other into submission, but we start from where we find ourselves.\nLater that weekend, in the same tent, the storyteller Martin Shaw reminds us that old stories often start at the point where the wild knight of the woods rides in to Arthur’s court. Change comes from the edges – but it doesn’t come from staying at the edges, guarding our countercultural purity.\n\n7. A labour of love\n\nThe Dark Mountain global distribution depot (otherwise known as Charlotte) swings into action at Southwold Post Office, October 2016.\nFor over ten years, Dark Mountain has been brought into being and sustained by the work of a growing and changing gang of friends and collaborators. There is no office. The books are stacked in a small Suffolk warehouse and sent out from a local post office. The collective that runs the project are scattered across several countries.\nWe all work as freelancers, living by our wits and fitting our work with this project in around the other jobs that help to pay the rent. We end up putting in far more time into the books, the events and this website than we can pay ourselves properly for. We do it because few things have felt more meaningful to us than being part of Dark Mountain.",

    "description": "We live in an era of climate crises, polarised societies and failed leadership. \n\nAcross the planet millions of people are already putting their efforts towards a better world for current and future generations. This wide-reaching work involves politicians, policymakers, business leaders, researchers, thought-leaders, social entrepreneurs, activists, community leaders and philantropists. \n\nYet we are failing to create the collective outcomes we need at the pace necessary within the available window of time of action. \n\nThe reason is that our perspectives on what we are doing (and why) are insufficient for the complex issues at hand. While there is no guarantee that embracing new perspectives will change the trajectory for humanity, we can be sure that we will fail, if we do not.\n\nThe Ekskäret Foundation aims to facilitate the co-creation of a more conscious and sustainable society where people create more well-being for themselves, each other and the world. The Foundation was founded in 2009 and has since then developed locations, arenas and contexts for inquisitive exploratory meetings, dialogue and lifelong transformative learning. Starting with youth camps the Foundation offer workshops, programs, conferences and work labs in personal development and social transformation. All with the purpose to increase our capacity to create the new story of a more sustainable and conscious society.\n\nThe Ekskäret Foundation works together with selected partners from business, non-profit, and academic sectors. The Foundation operates without profit interests and is a religiously and ideologically independent organization. ",

    "description": "Emerge is a network responding to the question of what is happening within, between and beyond human beings in a civilisation that appears to be dying. We connect pioneers, seekers, innovators and their initiatives. We highlight what we share and seek to make visible the patterns that connect us. We help each other to respond to the most urgent challenges of our time. Together, we will sow the seeds of a new civilisation.\n\n\nOur Project\n\n\nEmerge is a response to the meta-crisis, which shows its face in the emergencies of climate, politics, environment and meaning. We believe not only that our challenges are interconnected, but that we must connect in new ways to grapple with the most urgent problems of our times. Linking people, projects, networks and ideas, we investigate what is emerging. We are also a community of practice, exploring new patterns of living, working, being and sense-making. \nThe emergence of a more conscious society has already begun. Emerge connects transformative and inspirational innovators and initiatives across the globe. We spotlight the most daring pathfinders and visionaries who are using systems thinking, driving spiritual renewal or personal and cultural transformation, and who lovingly seduce cynical minds into seeing more beautiful alternative worlds.\n\n\nOn our website, we shine a light on those offering their work, wisdom and new ways of thinking. We tell the stories of the fast-growing multitude of renegade seekers and their projects, highlighting the patterns that unite the different tribes of transformation. Joining the dots between agents and actions all over the world, we seek to awaken the wild imagination needed for making the new civilisation a reality. \n\n\nWho We Are\n\n\nWe are a rapidly growing community of doers, dreamers and thinkers looking to create a new kind of “We.” Connecting individuals and collectives, Emerge celebrates visionaries who explore dynamic solutions to our planet’s greatest challenges. We are activists, artists and academics, entrepreneurs and educators, philosophers and philanthropists, spiritual seekers, soul workers and scientists. Diversity of perspectives and openness to audacious thinking are our core strengths. Showcasing and analysing the most daring insights from across the system-changer ecosphere, we seek to serve all those who share an Emerge sensibility.\n\nHow We Work\n\n\nWe connect and make visible. We celebrate people, their networks, their wisdom and their initiatives. On our website, we present carefully curated profiles and insights of the most daring system-changers of our time – the wizards, challengers and rebels, the pioneers, teachers, artists and healers. And the warriors. All over the world, networks and organizations are rising up to explore unchartered intellectual, spiritual or cultural terrain that invites new ways of being, thinking and doing. \n\n\nThese enterprises are at the heart of the Emerge network. We seek to clarify patterns, combine visions and link people and practices to create a powerful new social movement. Our mission is also to translate between the different tribes of transformation in the system-changer sphere, and to highlight the questions and practices that unite us.\n\n\nWe hold regular meetings and events in a growing number of major cities around the world. We meet for annual international gatherings (including two completed in Berlin and Kyiv). We aim to support each other, to expand our circles of belonging and to increase our collective agency and visibility.\n\nWhat We Want\n\n\nWe are at a fork in the road. Two kinds of possible future for humanity are likely: further entropy and collapse, or the emergence of a higher-order system that is more complex and elegant than our current one. While we do not hold the answers we know how we wish to grapple with the problem. \n\n\nThe emergence of a better world starts with a new social imaginary and new ways of working and dreaming together. We wish to inspire and inform the manifestation of the kinds of “We” the world needs to address the many crises of our time – a plural, humble and radically inclusive “We.” \n\n\nWe believe that inner change and social change are interlinked. Shaped by biological, social and psychological forces, we are embodied, encultured and embedded. If we want to save our souls, systems and societies, we need to foster our willingness to engage with complexity. We must re-learn to dance with uncertainty, to listen to the future and to combine insights from multiple domains in daring new ways. Perhaps most importantly, we must find new ways to connect with each other.",

    "description": "Larger Us supports a breakthrough from a them-and-us to a Larger Us world: one in which the ‘us’ we identify with includes 7.8 billion people, all other species, and future generations of both.\n\nWe do this by working to imagine and co-create new forms of citizenship and leadership – above all at the places where our states of mind and the state of the world intersect.\n\nLarger Us started out in 2018 after our founder Alex had been running a campaign for the UK to remain in the EU  – and realised his work was deepening political divides rather than helping to heal them.\n\nAs he thought more about political polarisation, he realised it was as much about our states of mind as the state of the world – whether we feel threatened or secure, whether we empathise with people or demonise them, what kind of stories we use to make sense of the world and our place in it.\n\nThat became the seed for our predecessor organisation, the Collective Psychology Project, which published its first report, A Larger Us, in 2019, pulling together ideas from over 200 conversations about the borders between our inner and outer worlds with psychologists and politicians, counsellors and campaigners, psychiatrists and peacebuilders.\n\nWe became Larger Us in early 2021, when we realised that we wanted to go much further than just publishing research – and instead become a co-created space for learning, sharing ideas, and asking the biggest questions about how we become a larger us rather than a them-and-us at a moment when everything depends on our ability to come together at all levels from neighbourhoods to nations.",

From loneliness and isolation to racism and tribalism, our disconnection from one another is causing tremendous suffering for people and the planet. Building on our 30-year legacy, we seek to better understand the role of the human mind in creating these problems—and its potential to solve them. Through grantmaking, convenings, and strategic partnerships, we seek to foster healthy human connections.\n\nWe recognize that Mind & Life is part of a growing global movement for social change. In this spirit, we welcome new partners—as together—we strive to create a world that truly embraces our shared humanity.",

    "description": "We are a non-profit organisation that bridges and integrates contemplative practices and wisdom with modern research capabilities. \n\nWe do that by working with leaders in the field of science, education, contemplation and human development using the knowledge in effective programs at the grass-roots level in Europe in order to decrease suffering and promote human flourishing.\n\nScience is the dominant framework for investigating the nature of reality. It is the modern source for knowledge that could help improve the lives of humans and the planet. However, an increasing number of scientists find that science based on empiricism, technology, and objective observation and analysis, does not provide enough insights to contribute to human flourishing.\n\nMind & Life Europe believes that well-refined contemplative practices and introspective methods are instruments of investigation that allow us to fully understand the human mind and the subjective experience of life. This is known as ‘contemplative science’.\n\nThis type of science has established that contemplative practice has measurable effects on the human brain, on nutrition and wellbeing. It has also shown that contemplative practice cultivates positive mental qualities such as care and compassion.\n\nBy providing a complete image of the mind and its potential to develop positive mental states, contemplative science not only makes science itself more humane but also ensures that its conclusions can contribute to human and societal flourishing.\n\nAt Mind & Life Europe, we foster an interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists, contemplative scholars, researchers and encourage them to collaborate to advance contemplative science. We share our findings with professionals in the fields of education, healthcare and organisations and develop solutions to implement change in these sectors.",

    "description": "The International Bateson Institute, registered in Stockholm, is a non-profit foundation for transcontextual research in ecology, economy, social change, health, education, and art. The International Bateson Institute supports a new kind of research that encourages and incubates projects, which examine the interactions within complex systems.\n\nThe aim of this research is to increase our ability to take into account the many relationships that coexist in any context of living things. In addition to providing much-needed perspective to existing research institutions, the findings of the International Bateson Institute projects are presented as seminars, media, and artistic exhibitions, which engage culture and education simultaneously in public spaces, for all ages.\n\nThe International Bateson Institute generates and gives access to information that offers a wider vision. The focus of IBI inquiry is on the interrelational dynamics between and interdepencies among systems.\n\nThe IBI research involves recognizing how patterns repeat and reflect each other across multiple contexts and across multiple systems – understanding these systems’ maintenance and renewal will be critical in the coming decades.\n\nThe underlying premise of the IBI is to address and experiment with how we perceive. Our mandate is to look in other ways so that we might find other species of information and new patterns of connection not visible though current methodologies. We call this information 'Warm Data.'",

    "description": "The Mindfulness Initiative was founded by Madeleine Bunting and Chris Cullen in November 2013 to support British politicians in forming the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness. \n\nOur partners include the four mindfulness training and research centres in Bangor, Exeter, Oxford and Sussex universities, as well as the Mental Health Foundation, Mindfulness Association and Breathworks, and we benefit from an advisory group comprising some of the most experienced mindfulness scientists and practitioners in the UK and around the world. Our patrons are Jon Kabat-Zinn and Ruby Wax, and our director is Jamie Bristow, who took over from the previous directors in May 2015. \n\nThe Mindfulness Initiative has a talented team of consultants 'policy leads' and associates who are engaged to work on specific strategy areas or projects on a part-time or ad-hoc basis. These consultants contribute immensely to our work, coming from the fields of mindfulness research and wider academia, mindfulness teaching, policy development and advocacy. \n\nWe are grateful for the generous support of The Lostand Foundation, Sankalpa and The Mindful Trust, among others.",

    "description": "The thesis of The Daily Evolver is that life is animated by the power of evolution, inside and out, and that we are riding a geyser of emergence toward a sacred world. In this blog I will make that case or grow trying!\nAlas, geyser riding is harrowing and I, like you, plainly see the suffering world. But what we also see is the arc of history, where with all of humanity’s wrong turns and regressions there emerges a clear trajectory of people (in the aggregate) living longer, more peacefully and with more wealth, century by century. A process that is accelerating.\n\nIn this view suffering is a call to action. None of us really achieves happiness until all beings achieve happiness. Thus, there is no end of work to do. But, please people, let’s do it with joy in our hearts, because we are on a sacred journey. And considering we crawled out of the mud, we’re doing pretty darn well.\n\nThis is what I try to point out on this blog. I am a current events junkie and delight in interpreting emerging politics and culture through a lens of consciousness evolution.\n\nSo to make virtue out of passion, I offer The Daily Evolver.",

    "description": "The Eco-Dharma Centre is situated in a beautiful and wild part of the Catalan Pyrenees. \n\nWe offer courses, events and retreats which support the realisation of our human potential and the development of an ecological consciousness honouring our mutual belonging within the web of life – drawing on the Buddhist Dharma and the emerging ecological paradigms of our time.\n\n\nOur courses and retreats take place in a context of sustainable low-impact living, closely woven within the web of elemental nature. These meditation retreats, study seminars and training camps are intended to help people to empower themselves to make changes in themselves and the world consistent with a life-affirming vision.\n\nWe seek to develop practices which honour the inseparability of the transformation of the self and the world; to support the shift from a destructive industrial growth society to a life-affirming future; to contribute to the creation of a movement of renewal and resistance; to evolve spiritual practice where courageous compassion and a deepening realisation of our radical interconnectedness helps us to live in solidarity with life.\n\nAlthough we live in a time of ecological and social crisis, a truly life-affirming, creative and sustainable future is possible. Such a future depends upon a radical transformation of both our values and consciousness, and the socio-economic forms that currently condition both the individual and our society. The goal of the eco-dharma project is to support such radical change, to transform insights and understandings into a lived reality – from the spiritual to the social, the political to the personal, and the imaginative to the inspirational!

    "description": "For The Wild is an anthology of the Anthropocene; focused on land based protection, co-liberation and intersectional storytelling rooted in a paradigm shift from human supremacy towards deep ecology.\n\nFor The Wild is a progressive media organization and nonprofit that emerged in 2014 from a deep sense of discomfort with the status quo and the yearning to both find what existed outside of dominant culture and consumer conditioning. For The Wild’s founder felt called to take a vow of commitment to the more-than-human world and this work is an extension of that calling.\n\n\nThe podcast was For The Wild’s first project and remains the heart of the organization as a powerful platform for critical discourse and coalition-building among accomplices committed to co-liberation, wilderness conservation, Indigenous sovereignty, ecological renewal and social justice. We seek to bridge the gap between academic research and practical solutions and make Earth renewal accessible by joining in conversation with grassroots activists, organizers, theologians, artists, land defenders and scientists who are often siloed in their respective fields and communities. \n\nWe’re continuing to learn alongside our audience while navigating the complexities and systemic injustices we face, as we walk together through the Anthropocene. Above anything else, we seek to disperse messages that will fervently feed our generation’s desire to break the cycle of exploitation that has brought us to the precipice of humanity’s existence. \n\nOur program is syndicated through the Pacifica Network and the National Federation of Community Broadcasters and is additionally aired by independent radio stations throughout places in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, the United States and more.\n\nFor The Wild is a female-led collective composed of a small group of dedicated creators, alchemists, and forever-learners who are committed to land-based restoration, social reconciliation, storytelling, responsibility, and education.\n\nOur work is built on relationships as we attempt to combat the rampant loneliness, divisiveness and emptiness pervasive in a consumer culture. We believe that people coming together and nurturing the interconnectedness with the Earth that humans need to thrive can not only build community but also may be one of the only ways forward to address some of the critical issues we are currently facing. \n\n",

Economic crisis, meaning crisis, climate crisis, health crisis, pandemic.\n\nTo survive and thrive in this century, we have to deeply adapt to the changing world. We have to redesign our systems not to be merely sustainable (maintaininng things or not doing further harm), but to actually be regenerative (returning living systems to health and full capacity).\n\nFuture Thinkers Smart Village is a vision for a regenerative living lab and education center to be built in the beautiful Wells Gray country, BC, Canada.\n\nOur living lab will work to prototypes in the areas of natural building, permaculture and food production, health &amp; wellness, regenerative business and economy, decentralized technology, community organization, new forms of governance, and whole systems design.\n\nOur aim is to create processes and templates that other communities can use to regenerate the health of the bioregional ecosystem, the local communities, and the people living in them.",

Looking for a term to bridge these worlds, we call ourselves a school for culturemakers. We cultivate the art of invitation, hospitality and friendship, finding here the seeds of other ways of being human together.\n\nHOME is a school that grows out of the conversations we bring together around our kitchen table. It’s a learning community and a gathering place for those who are drawn to the work of regrowing a living culture.\n\nIt’s the fruit of the projects we led, the books we read, the organisations we built, the people we learned with and the friendships that formed us over the past two decades.\n\nAnd it’s a new beginning. Something we’re figuring out together as we go along, with the help of that web of friends and collaborators.\n\nHOME is a school the shape of a pocket. An air-pocket. A breathing space.

Our local Zen community (Sangha) in Denver was a laboratory where we experimented. \n\nWe experimented with ways that we can add things to this exquisite waking up Dharma, the Buddhist Dharma, the Zen lineage, the teachings of 2,600 years, and more. Integral Zen is about breaking your heart open so you can take home this connection to selfless compassion and share it with those that you love.\n\nThe Mission of Integral Zen is to offer an evolutionary path to awakening and full human fulfillment, based on the teachings and practices of Rinzai Zen, and our root teachers Soen Roshi, Eido Roshi, Jun Po Roshi, and the collected works and wisdom of the integral philosopher Ken Wilber. This living community is non-dogmatic in its philosophy, and open to the evolution of its own processes and instructions.",

We live all over the UK, but we run a programme of camping activities in the South of England, focused around the teaching and practice of Buddhism and Buddhist meditation. We are perhaps best known for organising our own Festival and for the Buddhafield Cafe, which goes to festivals and fairs like Glastonbury, Sunrise and The Green Gathering. As well as this, we run an annual programme of meditation retreat camps and we cultivate on our own land.",

Prosperity enables basic individual rights and freedoms. But it must also deliver the ability for people to participate meaningfully in common projects.
